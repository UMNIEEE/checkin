            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The meeting check-in web app is a simple tool for signing in participants at meetings and events. A customizable interface
                allows for modifying and sharing custom styles to meet the desires of the user. Data is stored locally on the users machine
                and can be accessed and cleared from the web app. The users data is also available for easy downloading to several common file formats.
